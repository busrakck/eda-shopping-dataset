# EDA and Visualizing Shopping Dataset
## Project Overview
This project, completed as part of the Aygaz Data Processing Bootcamp, focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing trends within an online shopping dataset. The workflow involves preprocessing data, handling missing values, and creating meaningful visualizations to extract insights.

## Features
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Adding and handling random missing values.
- Implementing data visualizations using popular Python libraries such as "Matplotlib" and "Seaborn".
- Exploratory analysis of patterns in online shopping behavior.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy
- scikit-learn

Install them using pip: 

<pre> ```shell pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scipy scikit-learn ``` </pre>

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is loaded from a CSV file:

```/kaggle/input/online-shopping-dataset/file.csv```

Ensure the file path is correctly set before running the notebook.

# Structure
1. Dataset Preparation:

    - Load and inspect the dataset.
    - Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
2. Handling Missing Data:

    - Introduce random missing values.
    - Handle missing data using statistical methods (e.g., median imputation).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:

    - Generate visualizations for trends and patterns.
    - Analyze correlations and distributions.

# Results
- Visual insights into customer shopping patterns.
- Methods for handling missing data effectively.
- Reproducible workflow for exploratory data analysis.

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

```git clone <repository_url>```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```cd <project_directory>```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```jupyter notebook eda-and-visualizing-shopping-dataset.ipynb```
